# Small Games
In this repository I put some of the little games I've programmed as practice when learning a language. The games include:

## Black Jack
This follows the standard rules of Black Jack, playing against the dealer. The interface is completely through the terminal.

## Minesweeper
This follows the standard rules of Minesweeper, and uses the Swing library to create a GUI. The application also includes difficulty settings, but does not guarentee that the first spot dug is not a mine.

## Verba Adventure
This is a text-based RPG I came up with, in which you play as an adventurer who's hunting down a dragon. The game includes basic forms of socialising, exploring, and combat.
